Text::QuickTemplate version 0.02
================================

This module provides a simple, lightweight templating mechanism, in
contrast to most (or all?) other CPAN templating modules, which try to
be as full-featured as possible.  Text::QuickTemplate does not require
you to buy into any complex syntax, or filesystem layout, or anything
like that.

You create a Text::QuickTemplate object with a string of boilerplate
text.  Then later, you pass the object a hash of substitution keywords
and values, and it returns the filled-in result string.

EXAMPLES

    $template = Text::QuickTemplate->new(<<END_TEMPLATE);
    Dear {{to}},
        Have a {{day_type}} day.
    Your {{relation}},
    {{from}}
    END_TEMPLATE

    $letter1 = $template->fill (
         {to       => 'Professor Dumbledore',
          relation => 'friend',
          day_type => 'swell',
          from     => 'Harry',
        });

    $letter2 = $template->fill (
         {to       => 'Lord Voldemort',
          relation => 'sworn enemy',
          day_type => 'rotten',
          from     => 'Harry',
        });

That's it.  No control flow, no executable content, no filesystem
access.  Never had it, never will.


DEVELOPMENT STATE

This is a brand-new module, so be wary.  It has a decent test suite,
but it hasn't been extensively field-tested.  It should be considered
"beta" software.

If you find any bugs, or if any behavior of Text::QuickTemplate
surprises you, I would be grateful if you could send me an email
message about it.  Thanks.
